#The Apollo Guidance Computer
By Annie Kroo, Paige Pfenninger, March Saper

## In

For our final Computer Architecture project, we set out with the goal to understand Block 1 of the Apollo Guidance Computer and create a simulation that can run all of the commands in Block 1. 

We chose this project because we wanted to understand how early computers work and attempt to recreate one of the first computers with modern software. 

## What is the Apollo Guidance Computer

The Apollo Guidance Computer is the computer that was on board all of the Apollo missions. It provided, the guidance, navigation, and control for early space missions. The Apollo guidance computer is what allowed us to go to space and eventually land on the moon. 

The Apollo Guidance Computer was designed by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and was fabricated by Raytheon.

### Block 1

Block 1 was the first part of the Apollo Guidance Computer. It was the first computer to use integrated chips and Block 1 contained 4100 IC that each consisted of a single 3 input NOR gate.  

Block 1 had 12 instructions: Add, Count Compare and Skip, Clear and Subtract, Index, Exchange, Divide, Multiply, Extend, Subtract, Transfer to Storage, Mask, and Jump Register. We will discuss these commands in more depth in a later section.

Block 1 had two types of memory: fixed memory and erasable memory. The Apollo Guidance Computer had 2KB of erasable memory and 48KB of fixed memory. The reason that the Apollo Guidance Computer had two types of memory was because in the 1960’s computer memory was difficult and expensive to make and it took up a lot of space and erasable memory required even more space. The fixed memory consisted of small disks that were weaved together. Each disk was a bit and depending on how it was oriented during the weaving process it read as either a 1 or a 0. Erasable memory also consisted of disks that were weaved together, but erasable memory required many more connections to be able to change the orientation of the disks. We will discuss memory in more detail later.  

The user interfaced with Block 1 through a series of indicator lights, numeric display, and a numeric keyboard. The user would input different numbers that corresponded to words and nouns which would translate to instruction sets for the computer. The interface connected to the computer through four input channels and five output channels. 

The Block 1 computer was used for the first unmanned missions into space. The Apollo Guidance Computer was updated with Block 2 hardware and instructions for the missions to the moon.
