## Registers

The Apollo Guidance Computer had eight flip-flop registers. All of theses registers were frequently accessed and written to. The Apollo Guidance Computer only had room for eight flip-flop registers because they were large and required a lot of power. 

The nine registers were:

1. Z
2. X
3. Y
4. A
5. B
6. Q
7. 


regZ;
   	memory[1] <= regX;
   	memory[2] <= regY;
   	memory[3] <= regA;
   	memory[4] <= regB;
   	memory[5] <= regQ;
   	memory[6] <= regG;
   	memory[8] <= regLP;
