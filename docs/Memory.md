## Erasable Memory

## Fixed Memory

The fixed memory was also known as core rope memory. It was read-only memory. Core rope memory consisted of wires woven through ferrite cores that acted as transformers. Each core was set to either a zero or a one and the wires were woven through different core patterns to create bit strings. Up to 64 wires could be run through each core. 

Rope core memory was made by hand by women who were adept at weaving. For this reason, it is sometimes also referred to as little-old-lady memory or LOL memory. 

## Registers

The Apollo Guidance Computer had eight 16-bit flip-flop registers. All of theses registers were frequently accessed and written to. The Apollo Guidance Computer only had room for eight flip-flop registers because they were large and required a lot of power. 

The eight registers were:

1. Z – this register held our program counter
2. X – this register was one of the inputs to the ALU
3. Y – this register was the other input to the ALU
4. A – this register was the accumulator
5. B – this register stored the current instruction
6. Q – this register stored the remainder in division operations
7. G – this register was used as a buffer
8. LP – this register stored the lower values of multiply

The AGC also had several 1-5 bit registers that were used to store things like the extra bits needed for memory addressing and all flags.
